due_date: 2024-09-11

The homework is the same as yesterday. If you have your SSH keys configured and your home machine is connecting to GitHub with SSH, you're all set, no homework for you today. 

1. Configure your machines at home to connect to GitHub with SSH.
2. If you did not accept the assignments repo in class, please do it at home. This is the [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/EJjTxLAo). After accepting that assignment, you should have a repo created on your GitHub.
3. Clone the assignments repo on your home machine:
   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Go to your GitHub assignments repository that you accepted for this class. You will see a green button, "Code". You must click on that button and select SSH to have the appropriate link that will allow you to clone your repository and copy the link you see there.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Create a folder `CS_Foundations` anywhere in your home computer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- On your terminal, go inside the folder `CS_Foundations` to clone your repository and type:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`git clone PASTE_THE_LINK_YOU_COPIED_FROM_GITHUB_(git@...)`
